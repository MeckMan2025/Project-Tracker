# EN Helper: the voice engineering notebook

EN Helper is a second home-screen app on the same site, at
`https://everythingthatsscrum.meckman.org/helper/`. It is for students who
won't type a notebook entry on their phone, forget to, or don't want to open a
laptop. They talk for a minute, and it becomes a real notebook entry.

Students end up with two icons: **Scrum** (the whole app) and **EN Helper**
(only the notebook, one tap to start talking).

## What a student does

1. Tap the **EN Helper** icon, or the reminder that arrives after a meeting.
2. Tap the big mic and talk about the meeting: what they worked on, what went
   wrong or what they tested, what's next. Tap again to stop, then **Next**.
3. Answer whatever that didn't cover, one question at a time. Each question
   is shown and read out loud (in the same voice as the opening prompt).
   - Open questions ("What did you learn from it?"): tap the mic and say it,
     or **Type instead**.
   - Choices ("How did you test it?"): tap one, or **Or say it** and the
     answer is matched to a choice.
   - **What happened today?** arrives with the signals they described
     already ticked: check it and tap Next.
   - Last: a photo of the work, or a link to it.
4. When the last question is answered, the entry is complete: it counts, and
   it wins the meeting's attendance back.

**Every question is answered, the same as the typed form:** what they did, why
it mattered (and in their own words if "Other"), how engaged they were and
why, the project (when the team has projects), whether a mentor helped (and
who and how), which signals happened and every follow-up question for each,
what's next, and a photo or link. The first recording usually answers several
of these already, so a student typically answers about 5 to 10 short
questions, not the whole list.

A green **Got it** line echoes each spoken answer, with **Redo**, and the
back arrow goes to the previous question.

**Finish later** is always there. The entry and everything answered so far is
saved, but it doesn't count until it's done: the Helper shows **Finish your
entry** with how many questions are left, and the notebook shows it as "not
finished yet". Reminders still go to anyone whose entry isn't finished.

The same recorder is in the Scrum app too: the EN Helper icon (the page with
the mic) next to **New Entry** on the Notebook tab opens it as a full-screen
panel over the notebook, and **Back to Notebook** closes it with no reload. It
runs inside the app rather than in a frame, because a framed second copy of
the app fights the first over the sign-in.

## What happens behind it

```

  each answer saved to the entry (PATCH)

```

- **Nothing said is lost.** The first recording stays on the phone until the
  server has it, and the entry exists from the moment Next is tapped.
- **The first pass only fills what was said.** It's told to leave anything
  the student didn't actually say empty, because empty means "ask them"; a
  guess would skip a question they never answered.
- **The transcript is the record.** Every spoken answer is added to it as
  "Q: ... A: ...", so "What I said" in the notebook holds the student's words
  for all of it. Tapped choices aren't spoken, so they aren't in it.
- **If the AI is unavailable,** the Helper simply asks every question.

## Keeping it school-appropriate

A phone in a shop hears everyone, and speech-to-text writes down whatever it
hears, including someone swearing nearby. Three layers keep that out:

1. **The database (the guarantee).** `supabase/en_helper_clean.sql` adds
   `clean_notebook_text()` and a trigger that runs it on every text a voice
   entry stores (transcript, write-up, every answer and follow-up), whoever
   writes it: the speech model, the AI, or a student typing. Listed words
   become "[removed]". It matches whole words only, so "class", "assembly",
   "shell", "cockpit", "screw", "ball bearings" and "flame retardant" are
   untouched. To add a word, edit the list in that file and run it again.
2. **An AI sentence check (the wider net).** Before anything is stored or
   shown back, Llama 3.3 reads it a sentence at a time and takes out any
   sentence with profanity, sexual content, put-downs aimed at someone,
   slurs, threats or crude humor, listed words or not. It is told to keep
   normal robotics talk ("the shooter killed it", "kill the program") and
   honest self-reflection ("that was stupid of me, but I fixed it").
   `screenText()` in `ai.ts`.
3. **The prompts.** The first pass and the write-up are told the microphone
   may hear other people, and to use only the student describing their work.

If a spoken answer is nothing but removed content, it isn't saved, and the
student is asked to try again. Cloudflare's safety model (Llama Guard) was
tried and isn't used: it rated swearing and a sexual comment "safe", because
it's built for dangerous content, not for a school notebook.

## How it reads in the notebook

A voice entry is an ordinary `notebook_entries` row with `source = 'voice'`, so
the list, the book, Team Growth, the mentor log and the notebook attendance rule
all count it with no special handling.

In the book view it shows **What I said** (the transcript, word for word) and
**AI-polished** side by side, tagged *Voice · AI-assisted*. That is on purpose:
students and judges can see the AI wrote up the student's work, and didn't do
the work for them.

- The **transcript is never editable.** It is the record of what was said.
- The **polished version is editable** by its author: the pencil on a voice
  entry opens a small editor instead of the typed form.
- Fields the typed form requires (a photo or link, an engagement note) are not
  required for voice entries. The AI fills `what_did`, `why_option`,
  `category`, `signals`, `signal_data`, `next_step`, `mentor_help` and
  `mentor_name` from what was said, and leaves anything that wasn't said empty.
- A voice entry only says "Mentor helped" when the student said so.

## End-of-meeting reminders

Every 15 minutes a scheduled job looks for today's meetings on each team's
calendar. From 15 minutes after a meeting's end time until 4 hours after, it
sends one push to each student who:

- was checked in (marked present, **or** marked absent by the notebook rule,
  since that rule flips people who haven't written yet), and
- has no entry for that date yet, and
- hasn't been reminded for that meeting already (`notebook_reminders`).

The push goes to the student's EN Helper subscription if they turned reminders
on in EN Helper (the **Remind me after meetings** button after their first
save), otherwise to the main app's. Tapping it opens EN Helper; opened through
the main app, the Helper shows a **← Scrum** button that goes back to the
Notebook tab.

EN Helper's own subscription only ever gets notebook reminders. `send-push` and
`process-scheduled` skip it, so chat, tasks and calendar notifications keep
coming from the Scrum icon only.

Meetings with no end time on the calendar, or days with no attendance taken,
get no reminder.

## Setup (one time)

The app code is safe to ship before any of this: until step 1 runs, EN Helper
says "not switched on yet" and the Notebook tab hides its EN Helper icon.

You need a Supabase personal access token
(https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens, starts with `sbp_`; a project
`sb_secret_` key can't do this). Commands below use
`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_...` in front of each; put yours there. Use the
current CLI through `npx -y supabase@latest`: older installed versions lack
`--use-api`, which deploys without Docker.

Setting secrets restarts every function in the project, so their version
numbers in the dashboard all go up by one. That is expected.

### 1. Database

Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor → paste `supabase/en_helper.sql` (repo root)
→ Run. Leave the commented STEP 4 block at the bottom for later.

Then `supabase/en_helper_complete.sql`, then `supabase/en_helper_clean.sql`.
The first is below; the second is the profanity filter (see "Keeping it
school-appropriate").

Paste `supabase/en_helper_complete.sql` and Run. It adds `complete`
(an unfinished voice entry doesn't count, including for the notebook
attendance rule) and `voice_state`.

### 2. A Cloudflare API token for Workers AI

1. Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → **Create Token**.
2. Use the **Workers AI** template (Workers AI: Read and Edit) → Create.
3. Copy the token. Your account ID is on the Workers AI page, or run
   `npx wrangler whoami`.

### 3. Secrets

Make a cron secret first and keep it for step 5:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 24
```

Then:

```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_... npx -y supabase@latest secrets set \
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id \
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_workers_ai_token \
  CRON_SECRET=the_value_from_openssl \
  --project-ref wqxjmykphkacbjfxmvzd
```

Optional:

| Secret | Default | What it changes |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `TEAM_TIMEZONE` | `America/Chicago` | The time zone meeting end times are read in |
| `CF_TEXT_MODEL` | `@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast` | The write-up model. Must be one Workers AI lists under JSON Mode |

The VAPID secrets the push functions already use are reused as they are.

### 4. Deploy the functions

From `project-tracker/`:

```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_... npx -y supabase@latest functions deploy notebook-voice \
  --no-verify-jwt --use-api --project-ref wqxjmykphkacbjfxmvzd
```

`--no-verify-jwt` is required: the 15 minute job sends a shared secret, not a
user token, and the function checks every caller itself.

Then redeploy the two push functions so EN Helper's icon only gets notebook
reminders. Both run with "Verify JWT" on (checked 2026-10-10), so deploy them
without `--no-verify-jwt`:

```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_... npx -y supabase@latest functions deploy send-push --use-api --project-ref wqxjmykphkacbjfxmvzd
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_... npx -y supabase@latest functions deploy process-scheduled --use-api --project-ref wqxjmykphkacbjfxmvzd
```

### 5. The 15 minute schedule

SQL Editor → paste the commented STEP 4 block from the bottom of
`supabase/en_helper.sql`, remove the leading `-- ` from each line, put your
cron secret where it says `PASTE_CRON_SECRET_HERE` → Run. (Don't commit the
file with the secret in it.)

Check it is running after 15 minutes:

```sql
select status, return_message, start_time
from cron.job_run_details
where jobid = (select jobid from cron.job where jobname = 'en-helper-tick')
order by start_time desc limit 5;
```

### 6. Try it

1. On your phone, open `everythingthatsscrum.meckman.org/helper/` in Safari →
   Share → **Add to Home Screen**. Open it from the icon and sign in once
   (a home-screen app keeps its own sign-in on iPhone).
2. Talk for twenty seconds, tap Next, and answer the questions it asks.
3. In the Scrum app, Notebook → Read it: the entry shows "being written
   up…", then both versions within a minute.

## Costs and limits

Workers AI's free plan gives 10,000 "neurons" a day, shared by every team,
resetting at 00:00 UTC (7pm Central). Estimated from Cloudflare's published
rates for a typical entry (a one-minute recording and about eight follow-up
questions, half of them spoken):

| Step | Neurons |
|------|---------|
| Whisper, first recording (1 minute) | about 47 |
| First pass (Llama 3.3 70B) | about 120 |
| Spoken answers (Whisper, a few seconds each) and choice matching | about 40 |
| Written-up version (Llama 3.3 70B) | about 80 |
| **One entry** | **about 290** |

That is roughly **30 to 35 voice entries a day** for free. Past that,
transcription fails until the reset: entries still save, and the Helper asks
every question so the student can type their answers. If the team writes
more than that, the Workers Paid plan ($5 a month) lifts the cap; at its
rates, each entry beyond the free allowance costs about a third of a cent.

Recordings stop at 3 minutes (90 seconds for an answer). A 16 kHz WAV is
about 2 MB a minute, held in storage only until it is transcribed.

The question audio is 43 small clips (about 500 KB) recorded once, so reading
questions out costs nothing.

## Things to know

- **Microphone prompt.** An iPhone may ask "Allow microphone?" each time EN
  Helper opens. That is Apple's behavior for home-screen web apps; it can't be
  switched off from the app.
- **"Hear it" needs a tap.** iPhones won't speak until the person taps
  something, so the prompt is read on request, not on open.
- **Separate sign-in.** On iPhone, EN Helper and Scrum keep separate storage,
  so each is signed into once. Temporary passwords work the same in both.
- **Silence.** A recording with no speech saves as an entry marked "no speech
  was heard". It still exists, so a lead can see it in the notebook.
- **Retries.** A failed write-up is retried every 15 minutes, up to 5 tries,
  and also whenever the student opens EN Helper. The last error is in
  `notebook_entries.ai_error`.
- **No Cloudflare secrets yet.** Voice entries still save, count and claim
  attendance; their write-up waits without using up retries, and runs once
  the secrets are set.

## Changing things

**The notebook's questions or choices.** Signals live in
`src/data/notebookSignals.js` and the category and "why" lists in
`src/data/notebookOptions.js`. The function can't read those, so it has a copy:

```bash
npm run sync:notebook-schema
```

then redeploy `notebook-voice`. `npm run build` warns if the copy is out of
date.

**The question audio.** The clips in `public/helper/q/` are named by each
question's wording. After changing a question, record the new ones (unchanged
clips are kept, removed questions' clips are deleted):

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=... CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... npm run make:question-audio
```

Until then the Helper reads a changed question in the phone's own voice.

**Which questions are asked.** `src/data/notebookQuestions.js`. It is the one
list of what a complete voice entry answers, read by the Helper and the
notebook alike.

**Words that get misheard.** Add them to `GLOSSARY` in
`supabase/functions/notebook-voice/ai.ts` (this season's game pieces, your part
names) and redeploy.

**The write-up's tone.** `systemPrompt()` in the same file.

### Trying the AI step on its own

`ai.ts` runs outside Supabase, so a prompt change can be tried on a real
recording before it ships:

```ts
// try_ai.ts
import { transcribe, polish, cleanAiFields } from "./supabase/functions/notebook-voice/ai.ts";
const transcript = await transcribe(await Deno.readFile("sample.wav"));
console.log(transcript, cleanAiFields(await polish(transcript)));
```

```bash
# A test clip from the Mac's own voice:
say -o sample.aiff "Today we tested the intake ten times..." && \
  afconvert -f WAVE -d LEI16@16000 -c 1 sample.aiff sample.wav
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=... CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... \
  npx deno run --allow-read --allow-net --allow-env try_ai.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | Where to look |
|--------------|---------------|
| EN Helper says "not switched on yet" | Step 1 hasn't run: the voice columns are missing |
| Entries stay "being written up…" | `notebook_entries.ai_error` on that row; Supabase → Edge Functions → notebook-voice → Logs. Usually a missing Cloudflare secret, or the day's allowance |
| No reminders | `cron.job_run_details` (step 5); the meeting needs an end time on the calendar and attendance taken that day; the student needs notifications on |
| Reminder opens the main app, not EN Helper | They turned reminders on in Scrum but not in EN Helper. The Helper page still opens; turning reminders on in EN Helper moves them to its icon |
| Yellow "waiting on this phone" banner won't clear | The phone can't reach Supabase, or the session expired: sign out and in again in EN Helper. The recording stays on the phone until it goes |

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `helper/index.html` | EN Helper's page (second Vite entry, see `vite.config.js`) |
| `public/helper/manifest.json`, icons | Its home-screen name and icon |
| `public/helper/sw.js` | Its own service worker (scope `/helper/`), for its own push subscription |
| `src/helper/main.jsx`, `HelperApp.jsx` | The app: sign-in, recorder, Done, saved screen. `Recorder` is also the Notebook tab's panel (`embedded`) |
| `src/helper/Questions.jsx` | One follow-up question: mic, choices, signals, photo or link |
| `src/helper/questionVoice.js` | Reads questions out from the recorded clips |
| `src/data/notebookQuestions.js` | Every question a complete entry answers, and which are left |
| `public/helper/q/` | The question clips and their manifest (`npm run make:question-audio`) |
| `src/helper/recorder.js` | Recording and conversion to 16 kHz WAV |
| `src/helper/voiceEntries.js` | Phone queue, upload, save, attendance claim, processing nudge |
| `src/helper/helperPush.js` | Reminder sign-up |
| `src/components/VoiceEntry.jsx` | Side-by-side view and the polished-text editor |
| `src/lib/notebookAttendance.js`, `notebookPhoto.js` | Shared with the typed form so both behave the same |
| `supabase/functions/notebook-voice/` | `index.ts` (analyze, answer, finish, reminders, retries), `ai.ts` (Whisper, first pass, choice matching, write-up), `notebookSchema.json` (generated) |
| `supabase/en_helper.sql`, `en_helper_complete.sql` (repo root) | Columns, bucket, reminders table, schedule; `complete` and `voice_state` |

The transcript is the student's own words and is the only source of facts. Never add a fact, number, part, person, result or plan that the student did not say. If something wasn't said, leave that answer out rather than guessing.

Fields:
- category: Technical (building, hardware, mechanical design, CAD), Programming (code, software, autonomous, sensors), or Business (outreach, fundraising, sponsors, marketing, the notebook itself).
- what_did: one plain sentence saying what they worked on.
- why_option: the closest reason this work mattered, from the allowed list. Robot building, fixing or testing work almost always "Directly advances the robot design" or "Fixes a critical bug or issue". Use "Other" (and say why in why_note) only when nothing on the list is close.
- mentor_help: true only if they said a mentor or coach helped. mentor_name only if they named one.
- next_step: what they said happens next, or empty.
- signals: every one of these the student clearly described, usually one to four. If an adult or teammate helped them, that is "help". If they worked with a named teammate, that is "collaborated". Testing something is "tested"; changing something because of a result is "improved". Never include one that wasn't described.
${signals}
- signal_data: an object with one key per signal you chose. Under each, answer that signal's questions that the transcript answers, in a few words each (under 15). Choice answers must be one of that question's options exactly. Leave out questions the transcript doesn't answer.
- polished: the notebook entry itself. First person, past tense, written the way a thoughtful student would write it: clear, specific, and in their voice. Keep every concrete detail they gave (measurements, counts, part names, what failed, what they changed and why). Fix speech-to-text mistakes using this glossary: ${GLOSSARY.join(", ")}. Remove filler ("um", "like", "so yeah"). Two short paragraphs at most. Do not use em dashes. Do not use headings or bullet points.

Answer with JSON only. Use straight double quotes for every key and string, never curly quotes.

Example. Transcript: "So I was coding the arm, um, the PID was overshooting like crazy so Sam and I lowered kP and tried it a bunch, it's way better now, still a little wobble. Tomorrow add feedforward."
Answer:
{"category":"Programming","what_did":"I tuned the PID controller on the arm.","why_option":"Fixes a critical bug or issue","why_note":"","mentor_help":false,"mentor_name":"","next_step":"Add feedforward to the arm controller.","signals":["tested","improved","collaborated"],"signal_data":{"tested":{"what":"The arm's PID tuning after lowering kP","how":"Repeated trials","outcome":"It partly worked"},"improved":{"what":"Lowered kP on the arm's PID controller","why":"Test results","better":"Somewhat","next":"Add feedforward"},"collaborated":{"who":"Someone in my group","what":"Tuning the arm's PID controller"}},"polished":"I worked on the arm code with Sam. The PID controller was overshooting a lot, so we lowered kP and tested it several times. It is much better now, but there is still a little wobble. Next time I plan to add feedforward."}`;

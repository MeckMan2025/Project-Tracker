// What happened today — the evidence signals a notebook entry can carry.
//
// This file is the single source of truth for BOTH the entry form and the Team
// Growth dashboard. Adding a signal here adds its card, its follow-up
// questions, its summary tile and its chart series, with no other file
// touched. That is the point: the notebook has to keep growing without being
// rewritten each time.
//
// A question is { id, type, label, options?, showIf? }:
//   type 'text'    — one short line
//   type 'choice'  — pick one of options
//   showIf(answers) — only asked when the earlier answer calls for it
//
// Answers are stored under the signal's key, so entry.signal_data.tested.what
// is "what did you test". Nothing here is required; an entry with no signals
// at all is a perfectly good entry.

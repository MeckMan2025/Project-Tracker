// One coach often runs more than one team, and an auth account is keyed by
// address alone — so the same coach email cannot be two accounts. The team
// number is folded into the address as a plus-tag:
//
//   coach@school.org  +  team 12345   ->   coach+team12345@school.org
//
// Gmail, Microsoft 365 and iCloud all deliver a plus-tagged address to the
// plain inbox, so it stays a REAL address: the coach can be written to, and a
// password reset still reaches them. That is the whole reason not to invent
// something like team12345@teams.radical, which can never receive anything.
//
// The coach types their ordinary address and their team number; this is built
// for them, so nobody has to know the tag exists.
